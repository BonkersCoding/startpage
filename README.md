# My Startpage

A custom homepage built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, focused on being clean and minimal. 
It pulls a pallas cat photo from Reddit on load. Bookmarks can be added or removed using the "add" and "delete" symbols. When declaring a bookmark folder for the first time, it is automatically added to the folder list.

## Status

This project is a work in progress by someone who's just started learning web developement! Expect refactors, layout changes, improvements, and a sprinkle of chaos.

## Features

- Add/remove bookmarks with modal input
- Folder organization
- Cute pallas cat everytime you open your browser

## TODO

- Add option to remove folders *(soon)*
- Add search bar *(soon)*
- Add customization options (dark/light mode, colors, source for the picture)
- Add greeting, clock, weather forecast
